1. [Z/Z/Z/](http://zzzbase.com/), Sarah Caluag, Jeremy Douglass, Daniel Rehn   
Z/Z/Z/ describes the dimensions of cultural artifacts that are difficult to explain using natural language. We use visualization techniques with trial-and-error methodologies to explore individual cultural artifacts (e.g. a scene of animation) as well as larger cultural data sets (e.g. a director's filmography ). Selected sources include: cinema, animation, and videogames.
