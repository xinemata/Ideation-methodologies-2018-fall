#### COURSE DESCRIPTION

Ideation & Methodologies explores topics of materiality, system, body, and networks through a series of thinking and making experiments. By working both collaboratively and independently, we will study a diverse spectrum of artistsic processes and develop a cabinet of ideas and techniques through playing, assembling, testing, and breaking. 

#### MATERIALS
					
Please buy / order:

- Sketchbook (gridded / graphed)
- Ruled Index Cards, White, 3” x 5”, 100-Count
- Register an account on https://are.na. You may need to upgrade to a premium account ($5 / month) if you exceed 100 private blocks.

You will be using the sketchbook and the index cards to record to record ideas and techniques developed throughout the semester. Are.na will be used to create Artist Research and will serve as your online dossier for gathering visual / textual inspirations. 
			
Please remain flexible to acquire other materials appropriate to your interests.			

#### ATTENDANCE POLICY
					
Students are expected to be present and on time to class every day. Absences should be excused by a doctor’s note, comparable documentation, or an email from me a week in advance in which I say you are excused for a valid reason. Each unexcused absence after the second unexcused absence will result in a half-letter drop in your final grade (e.g. A- will become a B+). Three lateness will result in an unexcused absence. 

We will be producing most of the course work through in-class projects and you are responsible for reaching out to me or your peers outside of class time to catch up on what you have missed. 					

#### GRADING AND EVALUATION

Attendance   
This can only work negatively for your grade as described in the attendance policy. 

Participation		20%    
Verbal, critical, and informed participation in class. This means being present and aware — ready to contribute in real-time during both reading discussions and critiques. Personal phone and laptop usages are unacceptable for this class. Your willingness to engage in thoughtful exchanges in class will account for one fifth of the final grade.

In-Class Projects	20% 
Artist Research #1	10%   
Artist Research #2	10%
Artist Research #3	10%   
Artist Research #4	10%	    
Final Presentation	20%    
In-Class Projects, Artist Research, and Final Presentation will be graded on concept, execution, and effort. Points are deducted if you turn in an assignment late. You will lose all points if the assignment is more than one week late.  

#### GRADING SCALE

97-100 = A+	  93-96 = A  	90-92 = A-   
87-89 = B+  	83-86 = B  	80-82 = B-   
77-79 = C+  	73-76 = C  	70-73 = C-   
67-69 = D+  	60-66 = D  	0-59 = F   

#### EXTRA CREDIT

There are two opportunities this semester to earn an extra credit. You have the option to either volunteer at the Orange Twin Conservation Land on October 2nd OR you can write a two-page course reflection over the Thanksgiving break. 

#### DIVERSITY STATEMENT

In this class we make a commitment towards diversity by acknowledging the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A collaborative effort between the students and the teacher is needed for creating a supportive learning environment.

If a class member says that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, remember this is a valuable opportunity for everyone present to grow and learn from one another with further discussion. All class members are encouraged to discuss such instances with the instructor so they can be addressed with greater care in the future.

It is University policy that students with documented disabilities receive reasonable accommodations through access to classroom information.
